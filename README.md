## 05/24/2024

-- Wiped out search-images index on Pinecone
-- Started small, included `text_inputs` with sentences when indexing
-- Use `<select>` option as `name` value during query
-- Combining embeddings of images and texts into aggregates (concat expands dimensions to 1024, weighted keeps it at 512, but hit-or-miss somehow ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)

## 05/23/2024

-- Re-embedded images with `metadata.name`, new structure on Pinecone now has

```
{
  ID: aaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd,
  VALUES: [0.0348193273, 0.0330491178, 0.00437883893...],
  METADATA: {
    imagePath: 'data/Chansey-4f244b49f1f74aa78cfdc6b5f1f983a0_jpg.rf.34f41a60c5f0f27cad47ab2207f02132.jpg`,
    name: 'Chansey'
  }
}
```

-- query now works with metadata filtering, with string-equality check `$eq`, per doc: https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/data/filter-with-metadata
-- `vector` values are still REQUIRED, `filter` only narrows it down
-- `$regex` is NOT supported üòî

- `text_inputs` from `embeddings.ts` seem to have very little (or none) impact on the search results
- `image_inputs` generated seems to be driving the query criteria
